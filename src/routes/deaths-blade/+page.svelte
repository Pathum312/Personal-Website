<Title>Death's Blade</Title>

<Paragraph>
	In the village of <Highlight>Grimshorn</Highlight>, nestled at the edge of the ancient <Highlight>
		Darkwood Forest
	</Highlight>, lived a blacksmith named <Highlight>Orin Stonehammer</Highlight>. His hands were
	calloused from years of hammering steel, his arms thick as tree trunks, and his hair as dark as
	the coal fires he stoked each dawn. Orin was known far and wide not just for the sharpness of his
	blades, but for the enchantments he wove into them—gifts from his ancestors who, it was said, once
	forged weapons for gods.
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>
	Though his craft was respected, Orin lived alone. His wife had passed many winters ago, and their
	son had never returned from a distant war. Grief had hollowed him, leaving only his work to keep
	him tethered to life. Day and night, the rhythmic pounding of his hammer echoed through the
	village, but fewer and fewer came to seek his wares, for peace had settled in the land.
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>
	One stormy evening, as Orin toiled over a glowing piece of iron, a cloaked stranger entered his
	forge. The air turned bitter, the flames flickering as if in fear. The stranger, tall and gaunt,
	spoke in a voice like dry leaves.
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>
	<Quote>
		"I seek a sword, blacksmith. One forged in blood and fire, tempered by the soul of its maker."
	</Quote>
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>
	Orin looked up, meeting the stranger’s eyes, and knew at once who—or rather, what—stood before
	him. It was <Highlight>Death</Highlight>.
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>
	<Quote>"I have nothing for you here."</Quote>&nbsp;&nbsp;Orin muttered, returning to his work.
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>
	But Death merely laughed, a cold, hollow sound.
	<Quote>
		"Your time is near, Orin Stonehammer. Craft me a blade, and I will grant you one final day."
	</Quote>
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>
	Orin, defiant yet weary, agreed. For hours, the forge blazed hotter than ever, the hammer striking
	with a force unmatched. He poured into the sword his last remnants of strength, his memories, and
	his very soul. The sword gleamed like the night sky, its edge sharp enough to split the wind.
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>
	When it was done, Orin fell to his knees, exhausted. The sword pulsed in his hand, alive with the
	essence of its maker. He offered it to Death, who inspected it with a nod of approval.
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>
	<Quote>"A fine blade."</Quote>&nbsp;&nbsp;Death said.
	<Quote>"Your craft is unmatched, Orin. Now, take your final day."</Quote>
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>
	But Orin, with what little strength remained, smiled grimly.
	<Quote>"I gave you my soul in that blade. I have no need for another day."</Quote>
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>
	Death paused, then smiled in return, a rare expression for the specter. With a single swing of the
	enchanted sword, Orin Stonehammer fell, his body crumbling into ash as his spirit became one with
	the steel he had forged.
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>
	And so, the blacksmith’s tale ended, his legacy living on in the blade wielded by Death himself.
