<Title>The Throne of Broken Gods</Title>
<Date>Date: 17/10/2024</Date>
<Paragraph>
	The heavens trembled as Valkor, the Architect, approached the assembly of gods. Towering beings of
	light and shadow hovered above the battlefield, their divine forms pulsating with cosmic energy.
	They had ruled over creation for millennia, untouchable, unquestioned. But now, before them stood
	a mortal—Valkor, wielding the power of the <Highlight>Genesisstone</Highlight>. His eyes burned
	with the knowledge that he alone held the power to unmake gods.
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>
	The gods had come, not out of mercy or concern for the world, but to <Highlight
		>crush this insolence</Highlight
	>. Yet as they descended, a ripple of uncertainty flowed among them.
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>
	Among the gods stood <Highlight>Zephis</Highlight>, the Lord of Storms, his form crackling with
	lightning. Beside him was <Highlight>Sylvara</Highlight>, the Lady of the Wilds, whose body was
	wreathed in living vines and leaves, and <Highlight>Nayara</Highlight>, Goddess of the Deep, whose
	eyes shimmered with the endless void of the oceans. Lastly, the <Highlight>Sunsinger</Highlight>,
	a deity of light and fire, hovered above them all, radiant as a newborn star.
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>
	Standing on a distant cliff, watching this confrontation in silence, was <Highlight
		>Orlun, The Voidwalker</Highlight
	>, bearer of the Astralstone. He observed as events unfolded, his face emotionless, neither aiding
	the gods nor Valkor—just watching.
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>
	<Quote>“You dare challenge us, mortal?”</Quote>&nbsp;&nbsp;Zephis’s voice boomed like thunder
	across the battlefield.
	<Quote>“You seek to wield powers beyond your comprehension, powers meant for gods alone.”</Quote>
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>
	Valkor raised his head, a smile tugging at the corners of his lips. <Quote
		>“Comprehension? What would you know of that? You, who have hidden in your divine realms for
		eons, squandering the potential of this world.”</Quote
	>
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>
	<Quote>“You speak of potential, but all you offer is destruction.”</Quote>&nbsp;&nbsp;Sylvara
	hissed, the earth beneath her rippling as her influence spread. <Quote
		>“You corrupt life itself with your twisted power.”</Quote
	>
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>
	Valkor’s eyes narrowed. <Quote
		>“Life? Your ‘life’ is stagnation, nothing more. You hold the reins of creation, but you’re too
		afraid to wield it. You hoard your power, guarding it as if it were fragile. I will do what you
		could never do—I will reshape this world into something greater.”</Quote
	>
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>
	The Sunsinger’s fiery voice echoed through the air. <Quote
		>“You speak with arrogance, mortal. We are the guardians of balance. Without us, this world will
		burn.”</Quote
	>
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>
	Valkor’s laugh rang out, cold and bitter. <Quote
		>“Balance? The world is already burning, but not because of me. It is burning because of your
		cowardice. You cling to power like parasites, and now, it is time for you to fall.”</Quote
	>
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>
	Nayara’s voice, deep as the ocean’s abyss, resonated as she stepped forward. <Quote
		>“We shall see if you can match words with deeds, Valkor.”</Quote
	>
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>
	With a surge of her power, a wall of water rose behind her, as if the seas themselves had come to
	drown him. Valkor extended his hand, and the ground beneath him twisted, reshaping the earth into
	a mountain of jagged obsidian. His army of monstrous creations erupted from the soil, twisted
	beings formed from his will.
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>
	Zephis unleashed a storm, the sky torn asunder by bolts of divine lightning, but Valkor’s
	creatures surged forward, absorbing the storm’s energy into their grotesque bodies. Sylvara’s
	vines sought to ensnare him, but Valkor called upon the Genesisstone, summoning a pillar of flame
	that scorched the earth, reducing the verdant traps to ash.
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>
	As the battle raged on, Valkor stood in the midst of chaos, <Highlight>undaunted</Highlight>. His
	voice boomed across the battlefield as his creations tore into the divine beings. <Quote
		>“You claim dominion over the elements, but you have forgotten what it means to wield true
		power! You are relics of a dead age!”</Quote
	>
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>
	The Sunsinger, the last to fall, plummeted from the heavens, her radiant form collapsing into
	burning cinders. Her final words echoed faintly, <Quote
		>“You will regret this, mortal. Even gods have their revenge.”</Quote
	>
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>But Valkor’s victory was already sealed.</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>
	Amid the carnage, <Highlight>Kaelion</Highlight> stood, watching from the shadows. He was a young warrior,
	a Stoneseeker by trade, always hunting for power. As the gods’ bodies fell, something caught his eye—a
	glowing fragment of divine essence, a piece of Zephis’s shattered heart. The others were too focused
	on Valkor to notice, but Kaelion saw <Highlight>opportunity</Highlight>. He grasped the shard,
	feeling the divine power surge into his body.
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>
	With the gods vanquished, their celestial forms lay broken across the battlefield. But Valkor was
	not finished. The Genesisstone flared with power, responding to his will. The shattered bodies of
	the gods began to twist, warp, and rise. He pulled their bones and divine remains into the earth
	itself, shaping them into a grotesque and awe-inspiring <Highlight>castle</Highlight>—a fortress
	of power constructed from the gods’ very essence. Massive spires of bone and crystal stretched
	toward the darkening sky, with walls made of divine flesh and stone, pulsating with unnatural
	energy.
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>
	The castle loomed over the landscape like a terrible crown of victory, a monument to Valkor's
	supremacy.
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>
	Orlun still stood at a distance, watching as the castle took shape. He made no move to intervene,
	nor did he speak. His gaze remained fixed on Valkor, who now stood atop his horrific creation, the
	architect of a new age. For reasons unknown to all but him, Orlun did nothing—he simply watched
	the rise of the man who had <Highlight>slain the gods</Highlight>.
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>
	In the months that followed, Kaelion became a feared warlord, his strength amplified by the
	<Highlight>Godshard</Highlight>, a blade forged from the fragment of Zephis. The Stonebearers of
	the Iron Dominion were dispatched to capture him, and it was on a moonlit night that Kaelion
	finally confronted them.
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>
	<Highlight>The Stonebearers—Garith, Yenne, and Solan—approached Kaelion</Highlight>, their
	Aetherstones glowing with elemental power.
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>
	<Quote>“You can’t run forever, Kaelion.”</Quote>&nbsp;&nbsp;Garith growled, his hand gripping the
	hilt of his sword, infused with the might of an Emberstone. <Quote
		>“Surrender now, and the Dominion might show you mercy.”</Quote
	>
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>
	Kaelion’s eyes gleamed as he stood, his Godshard resting casually in his hand. <Quote
		>“Mercy? From the Dominion? Don’t insult me, Garith. I’ve seen what your masters do to those
		they ‘mercy’.”</Quote
	>
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>
	Yenne stepped forward, her voice laced with venom. <Quote
		>“You stole a god’s power. You wield something you can’t even begin to understand.”</Quote
	>
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>
	Kaelion chuckled darkly. <Quote
		>“Understand? I understand more than you know. This blade… it’s not just a weapon. It’s alive.”</Quote
	>
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>
	Solan, the youngest of the Stonebearers, eyed the Godshard warily. <Quote
		>“Alive? What does that mean?”</Quote
	>
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>
	<Quote>“It means”</Quote>&nbsp;&nbsp;Kaelion said, his voice calm but sharp as steel, <Quote
		>“that this power isn’t just mine. It’s a piece of something greater. And it gives me the
		strength to do what you and your kind cannot.”</Quote
	>
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>
	Garith, frustrated, lunged forward, his Emberstone flaring to life. Fire danced along his blade as
	he swung at Kaelion, but in a flash, the Godshard was raised to meet him. There was a momentary
	clash of elements—fire against divinity—before Kaelion’s blade sliced clean through Garith’s
	weapon, the flames extinguished in an instant.
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>
	Garith staggered back, clutching his shattered sword. <Quote>“Impossible…”</Quote>
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>
	Kaelion’s voice was cold. <Quote
		>“You were always chasing power, Garith. But the truth is, you’re bound by the very stones you
		wield. The Godshard… it wields me.”</Quote
	>
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>
	Yenne and Solan hesitated. They had seen enough battles to know that something was different, that
	this was not just a fight over relics. Kaelion’s movements were too swift, his attacks too
	precise. It was as if the god’s fragment was guiding him, bending reality around him.
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>
	<Quote>“You can’t stop me.”</Quote>&nbsp;&nbsp;Kaelion said, his voice laced with deadly calm.
	<Quote
		>“The Stonebearers can’t stop me. The Iron Dominion’s time is coming to an end. You’re bound to
		those stones, and that’s why you’ll fail. I’m not bound by anything anymore.”</Quote
	>
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>
	Yenne’s face hardened. <Quote>“Then we’ll die trying.”</Quote>
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>
	<Quote>“Then you’ll die.”</Quote>&nbsp;&nbsp;Kaelion replied, and in the blink of an eye, he
	vanished, moving faster than the eye could see. The last thing they heard was the hum of the
	Godshard, before the darkness swallowed them.
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>
	Back in his grotesque castle of gods’ bones, Valkor stood, his creation complete. He knew of the
	rising warlord, Kaelion, and the power he wielded. But he was unconcerned.
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>
	<Quote>“All power returns to its source.”</Quote>&nbsp;&nbsp;he whispered to himself, watching the
	skies above.
	<Quote>“Let him play his part.”</Quote>
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>
	For Valkor, the Architect of Ruin, had shaped the world—and soon, he would shape it once more.
</Paragraph>
