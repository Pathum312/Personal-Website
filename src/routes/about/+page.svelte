<Paragraph>
	Iâ€™m Pathum Senanayake, a 22-year-old software engineer whoâ€™s all about web development,
	automation, and digging into data through web scraping and web crawling. Iâ€™ve spent a lot of time
	building systems that make life easierâ€”whether itâ€™s automating tasks, creating efficient web apps,
	or pulling valuable insights from data. I enjoy finding creative solutions and seeing projects
	come to life in ways that make a real difference.

<Paragraph>
	When Iâ€™m not coding, Iâ€™m usually gaming, reading, or writing. Iâ€™m currently into medieval high
	fantasy, spinning stories filled with epic battles and magical worlds, but my real specialty is
	psychological horrorâ€”thereâ€™s nothing like diving into the darker corners of the human mind. Iâ€™m
	also a binge kind of person; once I start something, whether itâ€™s work, a game, or a book, Iâ€™m all
	in until itâ€™s done.
</Paragraph>
<Paragraph>
	I love what I do, both in tech and storytelling, and Iâ€™m always up for a new challenge or creative
	adventure. Whether itâ€™s solving problems with code or crafting compelling narratives, Iâ€™m always
	looking for the next thing to pour myself into.
